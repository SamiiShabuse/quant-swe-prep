# Quant SWE Prep

📈 This repository documents my complete journey to become a Quant Software Engineer at a top trading firm.

I'll be mastering C++, systems design, trading simulations, and performance engineering — and building a collection of real-world projects that reflect the kind of thinking expected at elite quant firms like Jane Street, HRT, Citadel, Jump, and Two Sigma.

## 🧠 Core Focus Areas

- Modern C++ fundamentals and best practices
- Functional programming principles (OCaml)
- Systems-level performance and profiling
- Low-latency programming and concurrency
- File I/O, memory control, and algorithm optimization
- Trading logic and quantitative simulations

## 📁 Project Roadmap

| Stage | Project | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | `cli_calculator` | A simple C++ calculator that expands into a class-based, history-tracking, multi-op CLI tool. |
| 02 | `trade_simulator` | A basic buy/sell simulator that tracks trades, position size, and simple P&L. |
| 03 | `latency_timer` | A timing utility that benchmarks code execution using `chrono`. |
| 04 | `order_book_sim` | A simplified order book engine that matches bids and asks using `std::map` and `queue`. |
| 05 | `backtest_engine` | Run backtests on historical price data using simple trading strategies. CSV parsing and file I/O. |
| 06 | `market_data_parser` | Parses large files of trading data and calculates rolling metrics. Focused on efficiency and memory. |
| 07 | `threaded_order_sim` | Multi-threaded simulation that mimics multiple bots placing trades concurrently. |
| 08 | `quant_utils` | Reusable math and utility functions (mean, median, volatility, etc.) in a modular C++ header library. |

## 🧪 Practice & Tracking

Alongside each project, I'll be:

- Solving 100+ Leetcode problems (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Reviewing discrete math, linear algebra, and probability
- Writing weekly technical recaps on Twitter (@SShabuse)
- Writing weekly technical recaps on LinkedIn (Samii Shabuse)
- Tracking performance metrics, speed improvements, and code clarity
