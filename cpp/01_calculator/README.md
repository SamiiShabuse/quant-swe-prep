# CLI Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator written in C++.

## 🔍 What it covers:
- Input/output handling
- Functions and return values
- Control flow with switch/case
- Error handling (division by zero)
- Project structure in C++

## 🧠 Why it matters:
This is my first C++ project to build confidence with syntax and logic.  
It's also the foundation for more complex quant systems — where every trading system boils down to efficient decision-making based on inputs.
